Welcome to Cernuda Arte
On behalf of our staff, we welcome you to our gallery. We hope that your visit will be a pleasant one. It is with great pleasure that we present to the public this selection of Cuban art from our inventory. This website showcases the works of the Colonial, Early Republic, Vanguardia, and Modern master painters, as well as the latest production of contemporary artists of unquestionable talent. 

 DEDICATED CUSTOMER SERVICE
Since July 2003, GalleryToday has been a purveyor of beautiful original art from all over the world, hand-signed by the artists who created them. At GalleryToday, we strive to captivate and satisfy collectors and lovers of original artwork with our diverse selection of paintings and our dedicated customer service. We feature a selection of paintings from both established and up-and-coming artists who are not only talented, but passionate about their craft, and we are proud to deliver their creations to your home or office.


 OUR QUALITY PROMISE TO YOU
All of the paintings we sell on GalleryToday are completely original, one-of-a-kind works of art, hand-signed by the artist. We do not sell fakes, reproductions, or prints. Each painting on GalleryToday has been personally chosen, reviewed, and inspected by a team of experienced, professional art authenticators to ensure you receive the highest-quality product available. We have a contractual agreement with our artists to ship their art in mint condition to our customers, and to notify us if they decide to sell their paintings elsewhere. This ensures that you receive a one-of-a-kind art, every time. We also ensure that our customers receive background information on the paintings they choose, as well as on the artists who created them.
